# Homework-Code-Refactor
In this assignment I refactored the code for a marketing webiste to follow semantic HTMl styling, added alt attributes to all images for accessibility, added a title, navbar functionality, and consolidated CSS styling for like classes. This was done without altering the functionality of the site.
